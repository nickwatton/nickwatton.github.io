  </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The impulse for this dissertation 
  resulted from a demonstration of 3D studio - new and powerful computer software 
  which allows sophisticated computer modelling in three dimensions. Realising 
  the potential this offered to theatre design, I chose to investigate further. 
  It was soon apparent that before I could understand how the technological advance 
  this represented might affect theatre design, I would first have to explore 
  the origins of what we currently accepted as normal practice.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Two figures who revolutionised 
  theatre design were Adolphe Appia and Edward Gordon Craig, both practising at 
  the turn of the last century, their work simplifying, yet enriching the whole 
  art of theatre, affecting actors as well as stages. I chose to pursue Appia 
  rather than Craig for this project due to his position regarding audience role 
  - requiring them to be active whilst Craig's theories left them passive (Part 
  One, Stage 1).</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This more active audience 
  role fitted better with the interactive possibilities that current computer-influenced 
  performance offers, and which I also picked upon in choosing to look at John 
  Cage's influence upon performance (Part One, Stage 2). </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I 
  have been deliberately selective and only addressed Cage, his collaboration 
  with Merce Cunningham, and the work of Robert Wilson from this most fertile 
  historical period. I could easily have examined the performance art of Yves 
  Kline, the installations of Joseph Beuys, or the theatre of Tadeuz Kantor, but 
  rather chose only these few examples in order to draw attention towards Cage's 
  theories relating to the increased audience responsibility, and Appia's continuing 
  influence seen in Wilson's use of light.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This investigative route 
  finally led back to my starting point, the influence and use of computer technologies 
  on current performance trends (Part One, Stage 3). Here I chose to look at the 
  'Hypertext' (similar in many ways to Roland Barthes' 'writerly' text), and 'Virtual 
  Reality'. These two elements of contemporary technology and performance have 
  radically altered the way in which works that use them are structured, performed, 
  and 'read'.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Whilst I admit something 
  of an historical leapfrogging, I request the indulgence of the reader in this, 
  given the limits of time and space imposed by a Master's dissertation. I invite 
  the reader to follow me as I make what I believe to be valid, if bold, connections 
  between the beginning and end of the Twentieth Century. I further ask that they 
  make connections themselves between the theory presented in Part One and the 
  practical element, Part Two.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Part Two is comprised of 
  a text and video element. The text describes a performance/installation, whilst 
  the video features the design for this, produced using '3D Studio', learnt especially 
  for this project. These work (I suggest), interactively with each other, the 
  form of presentation intrinsically linked to the content of the design (see 
  Part Two, Cover note). It is my intention that following Part One, Stage Three 
  the reader will come to view part two as an 'Hypertext', and regard part one 
  itself as an element of that hypertext, along with the video, video cover, etc...!

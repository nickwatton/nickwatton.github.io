    Wilson's 'operas'</b></font></p>
  <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Finally in 
    this Stage, I would like to consider the work of Robert Wilson who can be 
    seen to have applied certain of the elements demonstrated by the Cage / Cunningham 
    collaboration to his own work, as well as drawing upon Appia as an influence 
    in his staging. </font></p>
  <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It is of 
    interest to note that Wilson termed his extended duration performances 'operas', 
    calling to mind associations with the Wagnerian influence on Appia. This reference 
    to a musical antecedent evokes both a theatrical form organised around a music 
    structure, and Walter Page's adage that 'all art constantly aspires to the 
    condition of music'.<font size="1"><b><a href="endnotes.htm#39" target="notes">39</a></b></font> 
    Following the radical influence Cage exerted on the conception of music it 
    is unsurprising that Wilson's stage productions do not directly recall Appia's. 
    Where Appia worked within a traditional, linear and character centred, musical 
    framework, Wilson could be said to have adopted a Cageian musical structure 
    (non-linear, de-centred), as the foundation for his work. Despite this difference, 
    however, Wilson's use of light to sculpt the performance space in three dimensions 
    is clearly reminiscent of Appia's techniques. Indeed Thomas Woodruff, one 
    of the many designers with whom Wilson collaborated has said, 'with the exception 
    of Wieland Wagner, ... no theatre artist has taken Appia's pronouncement [that 
    light is the primary staging device] as much to heart ... as Robert Wilson'.<font size="1"><b><a href="endnotes.htm#40" target="notes">40</a></b></font> 
    </font></p>
  <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Lawrence 
    Shyer describes the work of the lighting designer Beverly Emmons, with whom 
    Wilson had collaborated. She was capable, at Wilson's request, of making the 
    actors become 'luminous' on the stage, or causing them to 'appear both hot 
    and cold at the same time'.<b><font size="1"><a href="endnotes.htm#41" target="notes">41</a></font></b> 
    Wilson used Emmons skills to focus his spectator's attention on the smallest 
    of significant details, be that a single hand in an immense stage, or the 
    perfect smoothness of an expanse of floor. </font></p>
  <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This precision 
    in the use of light clearly follows Appia's example, sculpturally defining 
    the stage through lighting. However, Wilson departed from a purist Appian 
    approach with regard to the status of the actor. Where Appia believed that 
    all stage elements should be used to throw the actor into relief, Wilson treated 
    all stage elements equally, hence Emmons' lighting of both hand and floor. 
    </font></p>
  <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Wilson's 
    collaboration with the composer Philip Glass for the production of <i>Einstein 
    on the Beach</i> followed the precedent, concerning the independence of performance 
    elements, set by the collaboration between Cage and Cunningham.</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Glass attributed 
    the success of his collaboration with Wilson to their each giving the other 
    'space in which to work'.<b><font size="1"><a href="endnotes.htm#42" target="notes">42</a></font></b> 
    This space came from the relationship between music and action, where 'the 
    music shapes the action in the same way as the visual structure does. It shares 
    with it a full authorship role'.<b><font size="1"><a href="endnotes.htm#43" target="notes">43</a></font></b> 
    Just as in the Cage / Cunningham projects, Wilson and Glass first discussed 
    the project and then separately composed their work. Once the compositions 
    were complete, they were brought together as to equal layers of the final 
    production. </font></p>
  <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In the same 
    way as the music and visual elements were layered, so the stage images were 
    set one behind the other, in parallel with the stage front. Each image independent 
    from, but bearing relationships to, the others, resonance's being produced 
    between, as well as within, the layers. Thomas Woodruff (another of Wilson's 
    designers), describes the aesthetic and organisational principals of Wilson's 
    stages, '[they] run in parallel lines generally and specific diagonals'.<b><font size="1"><a href="endnotes.htm#44" target="notes">44</a></font></b> 
    Accordingly Frantiäek De·k wrote in his article 'Robert Wilson' that, </font></p>
  <table width="75%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="center">
    <tr>
      <td><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Wilson's pieces are 
        not written but designed. ... The juxtaposition of images on different 
        horizontal planes, their focussing and defocussing, is the main principle 
        of Wilson's theatrical assemblages.<b><font size="1"><a href="endnotes.htm#45" target="notes">45</a></font></b></font></td>
    </tr>
  </table>
  <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">These assemblages 
    of images were approached following a similar philosophy to that employed 
    by Cage. It seems, however, that Wilson took a less systematic approach to 
    the creation of a performance's content. His productions, whilst often being 
    ostensibly concerned with an historic character (<i>Einstein on the Beach, 
    A letter for Queen Victoria, The Life and Times of Joseph Stalin</i>), would 
    take any association however tangentially connected with the subject given 
    in the title. Woodruff says, 'there's this completely arbitrary way of determining 
    the imagery. Once it's chosen everything is precisely detailed and fine-tuned 
    but initially it comes out of nowhere.'<font size="1"><b><a href="endnotes.htm#46" target="notes">46</a> 
    &amp;<a href="endnotes.htm#47" target="notes"> 47</a></b></font></font></p>
  <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This illustrates 
    the significance given to the chance find, the empty gesture, taken and treated 
    with the greatest significance. 'To me what something meant wasn't important', 
    Glass said whilst working with Wilson's visual images to produce the score 
    for <i>Einstein on the Beach</i>. 'What was important was that it was meaningful, 
    that's a very important difference. ... The conviction of meaningfulness is 
    all that was necessary for me.'<b><font size="1"><a href="endnotes.htm#48" target="notes">48</a></font></b> 
    In this way Wilson was able to construct a space for the audience to navigate, 
    in which they could compose their own meanings. Verbal text was treated accordingly, 
    Wilson being uninterested in the meaning of language, but rather its textural 
    and kinaesthetic qualities, producing as a result, non-narrative verbal scores. 
    Wilson said of this that 'we don't want to belabour you with a story'.<b><font size="1"><a href="endnotes.htm#49" target="notes">49</a></font></b> 
    The spectator therefore was to respond to the texture and energy of the language, 
    as they did with the visual and auditory images. </font></p>
  <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Even Wilson's 
    choice of performers contributed to this overall effect. Working mostly with 
    amateurs, Wilson's actors were generally people performing actions, rather 
    than characters. As such the spectators had to choose whether to view them 
    as actors or everyday individuals. This was made more apparent as these performers 
    were of themselves fascinatingly 'watchable', whilst as actors they were 'awkward 
    and impersonal, inexpressive, uncommunicative ... [acting so] accordingly 
    on stage'.<b><font size="1"><a href="endnotes.htm#50" target="notes">50</a></font></b> 
    </font></p>
  <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The final 
    element which Wilson controlled to affect audience reception of his operas 
    was their timescale. These works were many hours long (<i>The Life and Times 
    of Joseph Stalin</i> lasted 12 hours), and, as Frantiäek De·k reports, were 
    designed to alter the perception of the audience. </font></p>
  <table width="75%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="center">
    <tr>
      <td><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The duration of [The 
        Life and Times of Joseph Stalin] was an attempt to psychologically modify 
        the perception of the spectator. During the twelve hours, the spectator 
        had to accommodate himself to the slow tempo of the performance; as he 
        become physically tired (sometimes on the verge of sleep), his mode of 
        perception altered.<b><font size="1"><a href="endnotes.htm#51" target="notes">51</a></font></b></font> 
      </td>
    </tr>
  </table>
  <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The duration 
    was extended partly by dramatising large stories, but more significantly by 
    slowing down action to an exceptional degree. Simple actions like pouring 
    a glass of water and walking across the stage with it might take half and 
    hour. As a result all the many layers of the performance (set, lighting, actors, 
    text, sound), could be considered separately and / or together. The audience 
    were invited to make connections across the time and space of the performance, 
    and its subject, in as arbitrary a manner as Wilson and his various collaborators 
    had begun their approach to the construction of the piece. </font></p>
  <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In this way, 
    the smallest gesture could take on huge significance as, in their somnambulant 
    journey, the audience traversed the time and place given to them. As such 
    reality would shift - between dream and consciousness, reality and act. Just 
    as Cage had undermined the authority of the composer to dictate what music 
    is composed of, so Robert Wilson had also successfully shown through his performances 
    that what constitutes reality depends upon the perspective of the individual. 
    </font></p>
  <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">If the position 
    suggested by the work of these practitioners is adopted, then the very notion 
    of a singular, uniform, reality is challenged and undermined; 'reality' is 
    exposed as a subjective position. The consequence of reality's loss of objective 
    foundation, is that it becomes 'virtual', Since this theoretical position 
    was 'played' out (in the 1950's ,- '70's), computer technologies have developed 
    to a position where 'virtual realities' are very concretely in existence. 
    The media now debates society's concerns over 'virtual-communities' where 
    people meet and talk in an electronic space. The properties and values of 
    the physical world are not necessarily those accepted by inhabitants of the 
    'virtual' communities. Certainly, on a mundane level, the solar cycle need 
    not affect when people can 'see' each other. </font></p>

  </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The history of Western philosophy 
  has been irrevocably shaped (some might say overshadowed), by the methods of 
  thought and argument laid out by the three ancient Greeks Aristotle, Socrates 
  and Plato. The philosophies which they bequeathed to us are founded upon a notion 
  of absolute truth, which, in its singularity, provides an irrefutable solution 
  against which all other possible answers are wrong. This search for truth was 
  ordered into a system of logical debate: A problem to be understood is described 
  and the multiple positions and objections of the interested parties raised. 
  Argument ensued, leading to a single position on the original problem, (thesis, 
  anti-thesis, synthesis).</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">These theories have not 
  just been fundamental to philosophies and political argument but also to the 
  arts and in particular the dramatic form of theatre. These can be seen in the 
  traditional tragic structure described by Aristotle and exemplified by Socrates: 
  <i>Explication; Complication; Crisis; Resolution</i>. That this has endured 
  for so long as a template for dramatic structure (forming the foundation of 
  the 'well made play'), suggests the extent of Aristotle's pervasive influence 
  and the importance of the belief structures underlying the so called 'closed 
  endings' of conventional story telling and dramatic texts. That we have only 
  relatively recently begun to tell stories in different ways, (fragmented narratives, 
  ambiguous endings), suggests less a lack of creative imagination on the part 
  of the theatre community, than the huge cultural and philosophical shifts which 
  have followed the events of the Twentieth Century.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Whilst researching the influence 
  of technology on theatre and the correspondence between new philosophical ideas 
  and new types of Theatre (including work variously described as 'Live art' or 
  'visual theatre'), I came across various changes to the orthodoxy of Aristotle 
  et al. However, first I would like to briefly consider the recent and surprising 
  recycling of Aristotle theories in conjunction with computer technologies.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Brenda Laurel, interface 
  designer for Apple computers and author of <u>Computers as Theatre</u>, writes 
  in response to being questioned about why the Aristotelian dramatic structure 
  has been so enduring that,</font>

  <tr>
    <td><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">without doubt there 
      are more recent theorists who have made major contributions to the body 
      of dramatic criticism. But no-one has provided a theory of the drama that 
      is as comprehensive and well integrated as Aristotle's.<b><font size="1"><a href="endnotes.htm#1" target="notes">1</a></font></b></font></td>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In her role as a designer 
  for Apple computers, Laurel is interested in providing a 'user-friendly' interface 
  between the computer and human user. Such a meeting point must provide both 
  the computer and the human with a method of giving and receiving information 
  which functions well for each of them. It is Laurel's belief that drama provides 
  a perfect model for such an exchange, as a method of debate and also functioning 
  as a forum for the communication of ideas. She describes Aristotle's theory 
  as an ideal template for what she terms 'human-computer activity' in the following 
  manner:</font></p>
<table width="75%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="center">
  <tr>
    <td><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A reason for looking 
      at the <i>Poetics</i> as opposed to more contemporary theories (such as 
      post-modernism) is that the Aristotelian paradigm is more appropriate to 
      the state of the technology to which we are trying to apply. In order to 
      build representations that have theatrical qualities in computer-based environments, 
      a deep, robust, and logically coherent version of structural elements and 
      dynamics is required - and this is what Aristotle provides.<b><font size="1"><a href="endnotes.htm#2" target="notes">2</a></font></b></font></td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This perception of Aristotle's 
  <i>Poetics</i> as a coherent foundation for human-computer relations is however 
  based upon a narrow definition of theatre. One which 'attempts to represent 
  ... human behaviour ... in a form that provides intellectual and emotional closure'.<b><font size="1"><a href="endnotes.htm#3" target="notes">3</a></font></b> 
  It is peculiar that Laurel should adopt a linear and closed theatrical model 
  for her work with computers, which elsewhere she describes as being non-linear, 
  and open ended.<b><font size="1"><a href="endnotes.htm#4" target="notes">4</a></font></b> 
  This represents a mismatch in terms of the deep, underlying structures of the 
  two sides of the relationship.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">It seems particularly narrow-minded 
  to tie the latest technology within the confines of ancient classical thought. 
  This suggests a worrying tendency to restrict the potential of new forms within 
  the safety of tried and tested structures, rather than exploring the possibilities 
  beyond present limits (a theme to which I will return later). The declaration 
  of her awareness of post-modernism makes her position even more untenable. Within 
  a post-modern framework it would be possible for example, to draw analyses between 
  the theories of Roland Barthes, computer, and modern performance. Barthes' theories 
  (especially that of the 'writerly text'), might be used in such an analogy, 
  as whilst non- linear, they are both rigorous and coherent.<b><font size="1"><a href="endnotes.htm#5" target="notes">5</a></font></b></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In order to re-evaluate 
  live performance and scenic design as a complete event rather than from the 
  traditional basis of textual criticism, I have sought out critical thinking 
  which challenges the restrictions of Aristotelian thought. As shown briefly 
  below these include cultural commentators as well as philosophers, in order 
  to attempt a consideration of a range of thought which connects with the writings/practices 
  of Appia, Cage and Wilson. This is important because I seek to integrate theory 
  and practice and the introduction of texts from different disciplines.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Edward de Bono, in his book 
  <u>Parallel Thinking</u>, attempts to undermine, overturn and think <i>beyond</i> 
  the Socratic methods of Western philosophy in order to fracture what he sees 
  as the 'straight-jacket'<b><font size="1"><a href="endnotes.htm#6" target="notes">6</a></font></b> 
  of traditional linear thought. For example, de Bono suggests that we might approach 
  everyday problems by writing down all the possible solutions without value judgement 
  (in <i>parallel</i>) before creatively evaluating each of the possibilities. 
  This somewhat egalitarian method attempts to avoid the reactive binary procedures 
  of problem/answer by refusing to <i>solve</i> the problem until the unlikeliest 
  of possibilities has been mined for any hidden potential.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Unfortunately de Bono's 
  text becomes circumscribed by the inescapably commercial nature of its intended 
  use. Eventually, he, like Laurel is undermined by the reality of his own methodologies, 
  and although he attempts to think himself outside the 'box' of traditional thinking 
  he is very far from the radical philosophical provocation's of Roland Barthes 
  - the form of whose writing embodies its contents.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Leaving de Bono's theoretical 
  excursion aside, I would like to consider the recent use of technological innovation 
  in performance (including computer generated performance), through the perspective 
  offered by the work of Adolphe Appia, John Cage and his use of quantum theory 
  and finally the 'operatic' events of Robert Wilson. </font></p>

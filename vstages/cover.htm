  Note</b></font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">There was something 
  terribly alluring about the sheet of rotting metal in the hedge. Something that 
  meant I had to go back and check. Turning it over in my hands I was thrilled 
  to discover the range of colours on the underside. The sheet was cold. It felt 
  a good thickness for a cover - not flimsy, but not too thick to cut through. 
  Carrying my chance find home, the weight tested the grip I had on it, holding 
  it between thumb and fingers, hanging down. My thumb ached. </font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The qualities 
  of texture and weight, even of temperature, could all possibly be suggested 
  in a virtual version of the metal used for the cover of this dissertation. However, 
  the muscular discomfort in my thumb could not begin to be evoked. Perhaps, it 
  could be argued, the wrist-ache from using a computer mouse might suggest the 
  carrying-ache I experienced with the metal. But no, it would be mouse-ache, 
  not metal-ache. (It would also be a physical and not a virtual ache.) </font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This draws 
  attention to the phenomenological qualities of physical as opposed to virtual 
  objects, that cannot be transferred. This translation gap between the two environments 
  is two-way: Just as I could not reproduce the metal-ache in the virtual environment, 
  so the technique of morphing where (to be crude), two images are blurred together 
  cannot be replicated in a non-virtual environment. This does not point to a 
  lack in either. Rather, it illustrates that each environment has unique qualities, 
  capable of complimenting and enriching the other. </font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">For (scenographic), 
  design this can mean that whilst a virtual model may be most suitable for representing 
  lighting on a set, the textural quality or 'feel' of materials might be conveyed 
  better in a physical model. In utilising new technologies people need not adopt 
  an 'in with the new, out with the old' approach. Both physical and virtual systems 
  of design have many real strengths and all of these should be full of advantage. 
  </font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In its current 
  state as a cover, the metal works as a bridge between the creative process of 
  design and the practicalities of academic submission. The lock and rust (and 
  subsequent need to break the seal to gain 'entry'), are features of the creative 
  process, whilst the metal itself might have been an object in one of the cupboards 
  described in the design, or indeed recall one of the cupboards themselves (see 
  below). However, just as there are parameters in creative design there are also 
  parameters to the form a dissertation might take. Whilst it may well have met 
  my creative ends, to have submitted large and ragged sheets of rusted metal 
  as part of this work may have fallen outside the bounds of academic etiquette, 
  hence the metal is cut and contained within acetate sheets and plastic edging.

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">That virtual realty will 
  make inroads into everyday life is beyond doubt. The television news and information 
  services Ceefax and Teletext which only recently seemed innovative will soon 
  be outmoded. Yet even these crude precursors of the multimedia entertainment 
  carousels that will soon be available via our television sets are virtual spaces. 
  Within their environments you can cal up the weather, latest news, travel reports, 
  local cinema ... The inroads have already started to be made. Whether these 
  tracks, their expansion into the 'information superhighway', and all that will 
  travel down it is a good thing or not is open to debate, and some of those commenting 
  upon it (including those I have looked at above), proceed in a contradictory 
  manner. </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The artist Hanne Tierney 
  wrote in conclusion to her article 'Drama for Voice and Strings' last year that 
  'whatever television has left of our imagination is probably going to be atrophied 
  by Virtual Reality'.<font size="1"><b><a href="endnotes.htm#62" target="notes">62</a></b></font> 
  Tierney produces an actor-less theatre in which she replaces the actors with 
  materials, ropes, pipes etc. suspended and moved by strings. She places herself 
  at an extreme end of what she identifies as the modernist development, citing 
  Maurice Maeterlinck, Edward Gordon Craig, and Robert Wilson as her influences. 
  The work explores how rhythm, line and form act in space to create meaning through 
  the abstraction of gesture: </font></p>

  <tr>
    <td><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The gesture becomes 
      a symbol; the imagination is permitted its own interpretations, and that 
      in turn creates a much richer experience for the spectator.<b><font size="1"><a href="endnotes.htm#63" target="notes">63</a></font></b></font></td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The underlying principle 
  for this work is that, and here she draws a quotation from Craig's <u>The Art 
  of Theatre</u>, 'there is something seemly in a man when he invents an instrument 
  which is outside his person, and through that instrument translates his message'.<b><font size="1"><a href="endnotes.htm#64" target="notes">64</a></font></b> 
  Through this it is clear that Tierney holds that an artist always achieves her 
  effect through tools, through that which is outside herself. She argues that 
  even when a painter communicates suffering or joy through the human form, the 
  expression of those emotions is achieved the skilful use of the tools: paint 
  and brush. As she holds this aesthetic principle it seems curious that she should 
  have such a negative view of the creative potential for the tool that virtual 
  reality presents. Surely the potential for expression, and the creative experience, 
  is enhanced by the introduction of a new medium. Because of this I have to disagree 
  with the conclusion Tierney draws in her article, and its rejection of virtual 
  reality as something which will stultify the modern spectator's imagination. 
  </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">However, her argument does 
  raise a recurring issue in writings on virtual reality which I would like to 
  question: that the body of the artist is unsuitable as a site of experience 
  and for creativity. The physical world of such performance artists as Lois weaver, 
  Karen Finley or Ron Athey demonstrate that the body is most suitable as a site 
  for the expression of creativity. In the (still small), circle of Cyber-academics<font size="1"><b><a href="endnotes.htm#65" target="notes">65</a></b></font> 
  there is a growing rejection of the body as a useful interface with virtual 
  experience. As one of cyber-guru (and philosophy lecturer), Nick Land's students 
  says, 'the real problem is skin, though. Skin as an organism is just very, very 
  limited'.<b><font size="1"><a href="endnotes.htm#66" target="notes">66</a></font></b> 
  Rather than being a convincing argument that the body is limited, this reveals 
  a restricted vision of the potential for physical stimulation. Whilst entertainment 
  media since the early cinema have made concerted appeals to the senses, most, 
  including virtual media, have concentrated on sight and sound. Given this preoccupation 
  it is clear that enthusiasts of the extra-body find the body limited - yet they 
  overlook the olfactory and tactile - the seemingly most evocative of the human 
  senses.<b><font size="1"><a href="endnotes.htm#67" target="notes">67</a></font></b> 
  </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">As the leading premise of 
  this dissertation would indicate, (taking as its foundation the actor based 
  theories of Appia rather than Craig's Uber Marionette), I am in favour of the 
  living body as a means and site of expression. However, whilst I hold the body 
  dear, I am also happy for its boundaries to be extended. The video artist Gary 
  Hill seems to create just such an extension. In his installation pieces Hill 
  combines a use of the body with the creation of a new (virtual) reality. </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">One of the pieces (<i>In 
  As It Is Always Already Taking Place</i>), in the exhibition of his work, <i>Tall 
  Ships</i> at the Liverpool Tate (April - May 1994), comprised a chest high alcove 
  containing many differently sized video screens. Each screen displayed a different 
  part of his body, such that his whole body was represented but dispersed, each 
  part separate and out of sequence, to no consistent scale, no coherent orientation. 
  The screens were piled up in clumps, an large screen showing his curved spine 
  placed next to another bracketing off his hairy upper chest and neck, the head 
  extended back exposing the adams-apple. Alongside was the stomach and penis, 
  gently rising and falling with breath. His legs, starting at mid-thigh and ending 
  above the ankles. In front of this group was another of smaller screens: thumbnail; 
  his closed left eye and forehead - an ear. Another screen, the smallest and 
  separate from any others, carried an ambiguous image of skin. (This last turned 
  out to be a section from the palm of his hand.) </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">From outside the alcove 
  I received a grotesque impression of the frailty of the body revealed in the 
  severing of each part from its usual companion. The strength of a back, power 
  of voice, delicacy and skill of hand: These associations played no part in the 
  isolated images presented - The body limited, impotent. However, on placing 
  my head within the alcove, I became aware of the energy, heat and sound as well 
  as image, given off by the numerous screens. From this I developed an understanding 
  of the separate existence (life), of each body-part/screen. Each body-part gaining 
  identity and strength from its separation from other body-parts and its combination 
  with technology. The breath in the stomach as no longer to fuel the (here disconnected), 
  legs but served to gently raise and lower itself, filling and emptying the screen 
  with steady regularity. The legs, free of their habitual burden, were beautiful 
  in and of themselves through their positioning relative to each other, the screen, 
  me. Man and machine (screen), had here combined to extend my knowledge of my 
  own physicality. The virtual and the physical colluding to extend my understanding 
  of the physical body, transforming in into a text of bliss. </font></p>

    <td><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Virtual Reality is 
      more complicated than either supreme control over the body, or simple abandonment

</table>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Like the work of Gary Hill, 
  the autobiography of Science Fiction author William Gibson can be seen to embrace 
  these notions of control, seduction and abandonment, creating Barthes' text 
  in which 'the subject unmakes himself, like a spider dissolving in the constructive 
  secretions of its web'.<font size="1"><b><a href="endnotes.htm#69" target="notes">69</a></b></font> 
  In writing his autobiography Gibson enmeshed his life into a computer hypertext 
  trough which the reader was invited to construct their own pathway. Written 
  exclusively on computer disk the text existed only in a virtual state. As the 
  reader read, the text destroyed itself. In this way the text took on the heat 
  of being 'alive', incandescent for the duration through which the reader immersed 
  themselves in the text. When the reading stopped the text ceased to exist. Can 
  there be a more literal example of Barthes' assertion that 'meanings die when 
  reading stops'?<b><font size="1"><a href="endnotes.htm#70" target="notes">70</a></font></b> 
  </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This example of a literary 
  text makes 'hazy' the borders of performance. Constructed as a hypertext, and 
  like a Wilson opera, each copy will be read differently, as no two readers are 
  likely to take the path through the text. Once read (performed), the text vanishes. 
  Like a performance the reading act Gibson's autobiography allows can only be 
  remembered, not re-viewed. In this way Gibson has been able to open out a performance 
  niche within the virtual environment, beyond any of Landow's visions. </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Through this text / performance 
  the reader dissolves into the (un)making of Gibson('s) 'constructive secretions': 
  his life / text. </font></p>

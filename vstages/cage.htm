      <td><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Theatre has traditionally 
        reflected the belief that language accurately captures reality: the principle 
        medium of drama, as Aristotle believed it should be, has been language. 
        We have been able to regard the text as the play itself, to analyse a 
        play in terms of its meaning, and the speech or a character in terms of 
        its single unified action or intention. Finding that language does not 
        faithfully represent experience [...] the arts in general have moved away 
        from language and have tended toward the condition of music: they have 
        become more self-referential and untranslatable. The influence of the 
        visual arts, moreover, has caused theatre to become more spatial, and 
        the influence of dance has caused it to rely more on kinaesthetic expression. 
        Because Cage empasizes music as a performance art and has conceived of 
        it in visual and spatial terms, he, of all musicians, has most directly 
        influenced contemporary theatre.<font size="1"><b><a href="endnotes.htm#27" target="notes">27</a></b></font></font></td>

  <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The works of John Cage 
    and those who followed or worked with him, reflect the changes in science's 
    understanding of nature. This came about as a result of the theoretical findings 
    of quantum physics. The central theoretical shift that quantum physics proposes 
    is that nature is not unitary and objectively observable. Rather, the act 
    of observing an event influences the outcome. (See note <font size="1"><b><a href="endnotes.htm#28" target="notes">28</a></b></font>) 
    If this is accepted then the perspective, both physical and mental, of an 
    observer dictates what they see. Furthermore, no one (necessarily) subjective 
    perspective has authority over any other, as all positions are <i>equally</i> 
    subjective. This second element applies not only to people, but to anything.<b><font size="1"><a href="endnotes.htm#29" target="notes">29</a></font></b> 
    As a consequence of this, Aristotle's belief in a single underlying 'truth' 
    or 'reality', discoverable through objective reasoning and presentable through 
    art, has to be rejected, as there can only be subjective positions on any 
    given subject. Moreover, Aristotle's restrictive hierarchical framework which 
    positions Mankind centrally in the scheme of creation is also undermined. 
    Humans are revealed to have the same (un)important status as everything else. 
    </font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In aligning himself with 
    this quantum perspective on nature, Cage had to reconsider the function of 
    the various roles in the creation and reception of art. Given the last point, 
    the 'artist' can have, as an example, no greater claim to the creation of 
    music than an audience member. Equally, no sound should be raised above any 
    other and given the distinction of being 'music'. In <u>Actors and Onlookers</u> 
    Natalie Chrohn Schmitt recounts the following episode, illustrating both element 
    of this new equality: </font></p>

      <td><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"But seriously", 
        remarked one reviewer, understanding that Cage meant music to be just 
        sounds, "if this is what music is, I could write it as well as you". And 
        Cage agrees.<b><font size="1"><a href="endnotes.htm#30" target="notes">30</a></font></b></font></td>

  <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Cage's composition <i>4'33"</i> 
    serves to illustrate how this theory functions in (musical) practice. This 
    piece was composed for piano in three movements, where the title described 
    the duration of the performance; 4 minutes and 33 seconds.<b><font size="1"><a href="endnotes.htm#31" target="notes">31</a></font></b> 
    Throughout the 'playing of <i>4'33"</i> the pianist only touched the piano 
    twice: Once to raise the lid at the beginning of the performance and once 
    to lower it again at the end. Each of the three movements were to be indicated 
    with an (undefined), hand gesture by the pianist, at again undefined intervals. 
    </font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Approached from a traditional 
    standpoint, it would appear that such a performance was silent. Nevertheless, 
    from the Cageian perspective, the act of listening to <i>4'33"</i> itself 
    brought forth music. Each listener created their own music out of the sounds 
    heard over the silent piano. Cage wrote of the audience that 'the hearing 
    of the piece is his own action - that the music, so to speak, is his, rather 
    than the composer's.'<font size="1"><b><a href="endnotes.htm#32" target="notes">32</a></b></font> 
    The performance of the score provided time and space for the contemplation 
    of the individual's observations of the event. What 'music' any individual 
    may have heard would depend upon their aesthetic and spatial perspective. 
    The sounds from which an individual could compose their music would depend 
    upon factors such as where in the room they were, the digestive noises and 
    breathing of their neighbours. If, as mentioned above, a listener held a traditional 
    aesthetic perspective they may well have heard no music at all. </font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In <i>4'33"</i> the authority 
    of the composer to dictate what their audience perceives, was clearly given 
    up. Such a performance made explicit what was clear within less minimalist 
    productions; it acknowledged that an artist cannot control what their audience 
    receives from a production. Even in a traditional performance event factors 
    like location, weather, temperament, hunger, political persuasion etc. will 
    effect audience reception. By working in the way he did Cage deliberately 
    utilised such commonplace indeterminacies as the strength, or in this case 
    the focus, of his art, rather than considering them as negative distractions.

  Three</b></font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The impact 
  of computer technologies on performance at the end of the Twentieth Century.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">As computers have been brought 
  within the conscious sphere of performance, do they have brought with them new 
  language elements, terms to describe the electronic environment: 'virtual reality', 
  'hypertext', 'interactive interface'. The meaning (or sense), of such descriptive 
  terms has altered as their relationship with performance has developed. For 
  example, an 'interactive interface' in a purely computer environment indicates 
  a two-way communication between a computer and its (human), user: a keyboard 
  and a screen in its simplest manifestation. Within a performance environment 
  the communication is between audience and performer and may indicate applause, 
  post-show discussion (formally or in the bar), or an audience's direct influence 
  upon a production during a performance. The other two terms, above, are central 
  to my further consideration of the effects of technologies on modern performance. 
  I shall, for a sense of balance, approach 'hypertext' through its technological 
  origins, and 'virtual reality' from a performance perspective. </font></p>
<p align="center"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>'Hypertext' 
  and Roland Barthes' 'writerly' text</b></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In his book <u>Hypertext</u>, 
  George Landow explores the relationship between technology and critical theory. 
  In this work he takes into account the social environment contemporary with 
  his writing. He characterises this as de-centred, relationships forming in 'webs' 
  rather than progressing in a linear fashion. In taking this approach Landow 
  is receptive to both the real experience of modern life<font size="1"><b><a href="endnotes.htm#52" target="notes">52</a></b></font> 
  and the current state of computer technology. The challenge his writing tries 
  to address concerns what he sees as the convergence between recent theories 
  of writing (Roland Barthes), and computer technologies which can make these 
  textual visions apparent. For the type of text he is describing, Landow uses 
  the term 'hypertext'. </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The term hypertext was first 
  coined by computer theorist Theodor Nelson whose definition (from <u>Literary 
  Machines</u>), Landow quotes: </font></p>
<table width="75%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="center">
  <tr>
    <td><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">By hypertext I mean 
      nonsequential writing - text that branches and allows choices to the reader, 
      best read at an interactive screen. As popularly conceived, this is a series 
      of text chunks connected by links which offer the reader different pathways.<b><font size="1"><a href="endnotes.htm#53" target="notes">53</a></font></b></font></td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The original conception 
  of such a reader-led literary experience was outlined by Nelson's mentor Vannevar 
  Bush who wrote an article for <u>Atlantic Monthly</u> (1945) in which he described 
  a mechanical structure called 'Memex'. This would search for and retrieve chosen 
  texts at great speed for a reader positioned at a transparent-topped desk. Bush 
  envisioned that not only would the reader be able to call up desired texts but 
  that they would be able to append these texts, adding separate notes, allowing 
  connections to be seen and noted between the text 'at hand' and others within 
  the Memex library. In this way Bush believed that the Memex would function as 
  'an enlarged intimate supplement to his [the reader's] memory.'<b><font size="1"><a href="endnotes.htm#54" target="notes">54</a></font></b> 
  </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Making a connection between 
  the reader led experience implied by the Bush / Nelson vision and Roland Barthes' 
  'writerly' text, Landow writes that 'hypertext creates an almost embarrassingly 
  literal embodiment of ... Barthes' conception of the readerly versus the writerly 
  text'.<b><font size="1"><a href="endnotes.htm#55" target="notes">55</a></font></b> 
  </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In S/Z Barthes describes 
  the situation of the writerly text where no single text exists in isolation, 
  but is rather an 'entrance into a network with a thousand entrances'.<font size="1"><b><a href="endnotes.htm#56" target="notes">56</a></b></font> 
  Furthermore, in Barthes' essay 'The Death of the Author' he writes of the text 
  that it, </font></p>
<table width="75%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="center">
  <tr>
    <td><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">is not a line of words 
      releasing a single 'theological' meaning (the 'message', of the Author-God) 
      but a multi-dimentional space in which a variety of writings, none of them 
      original, blend and clash.<font size="1"><b><a href="endnotes.htm#57" target="notes">57</a></b></font></font></td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">From this it can be seen 
  that there is indeed a connection between the concept of hypertext and Barthes' 
  description of the writerly text. However, Landow does not follow through the 
  possibilities implied by the technology about which he is writing, with regard 
  to this connection. </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The exploration of this 
  new and exciting area, the computer hypertext, seems to be an area of investigation 
  rich in potential. Having explained Memex as the original conception of the 
  hypertext machine, and then described Barthes' writerly text as the hypertext 
  incarnate, Landow reduces these visionary ideas, revolutionary insights, and 
  creative expositions into a dry and cautious singularity. </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Landow has imaginatively 
  envisaged the multiple possibilities in the work that he draws our attention 
  to, and the convergence I mention above. However, he makes an error in seeing 
  these two fields (critical theory and computer technology), as moving towards 
  the same point from different directions. They are not. What he presents as 
  'The' convergence, is rather 'a' convergence. The two are not the same. The 
  theories he mentions do interrelate but they are not aiming towards the same 
  particular goal. Rather they represent theorists who herald a recognition that 
  the organising principles of thought need not necessarily be those that Western 
  philosophy (based upon the proposals Aristotle et. al.), has assumed them to 
  be. </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The manner in which these 
  changes in thought are developing together is quite apparently away from the 
  singular, towards the multiple. Landow is right to draw attention to this convergence 
  in two seemingly disparate fields, but he does not manage to move on from the 
  'old' methods in his exploration of the new. What he performs is really only 
  a slight of hand, discrediting the pre-computer textual composition by using 
  such descriptive terms as 'old-fashioned', and 'supposedly authoritative', in 
  order to usher in the 'new' methodology he champions to great aplomb. However, 
  rather than actively exploring the deepest corners of the links between the 
  new technologies and methodologies to discover their full potential, he merely 
  reintroduces the old methods through new terminology. </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Landow makes assumptions 
  of the traditional reading pattern similar to those made by Laurel. Each assumes 
  a linear reading (and construction), of a text, Laurel prescribing that 'drama 
  attempts to represent ... human behaviour ... in a form that provides intellectual 
  and emotional closure'.<b><font size="1"><a href="endnotes.htm#58" target="notes">58</a></font></b> 
  Conflicting with this, the structure of one of Wilson's 'operas' could easily 
  be described as hypertextual, 'compose of blocks and links that permits multilinear 
  reading paths'.<b><font size="1"><a href="endnotes.htm#59" target="notes">59</a></font></b> 
  </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">That such performance pre-dates 
  both Landow's and Laurel's writing is testament to a lack of foreknowledge of 
  the field about which they have written. To demonstrate their lack of vision 
  one need look no further than the <u>Sunday Observer Review</u> which ran an 
  article covering William Forsythe's ballet 'Alie/na(c)tion'. The movement in 
  the first section of this performance was determined by computer, resulting 
  in a Cageian composition where, 'there was no way to keep track of the seemingly 
  random activity, other than to pick a dancer - any dancer - and follow his or 
  her trajectory through the maze'. The production left the reviewer Jann Parry 
  with questions that Landow and Laurel might have done well to ask themselves: 
  'Why do we value harmony so much? Must we have order before we can appreciate 
  any alternative way of looking at the world?'<b><font size="1"><a href="endnotes.htm#60" target="notes">60</a></font></b> 
  </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I feel that it is only fair 
  to finally appraise Landow and Laurel's reading of their various cultural, artistic 
  and technological texts (which have the potential to be taken as 'texts of bliss', 
  and which they take as 'texts of pleasure'), through the words of Barthes. </font></p>

    <td><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Texts of pleasure: 
      that text that contents, fills, grants euphoria; the text that comes from 
      culture and does not break with it, is linked to a <i>comfortable</i> practice 
      of reading. Text of bliss: the text that imposes a state of loss, the text 
      that discomforts (perhaps to the point of a certain boredom), unsettles 
      the reader's historical, cultural, psychological assumptions, the consistency 
      of his tastes, values, memories, brings to a crisis his relation to language.<font size="1"><b><a href="endnotes.htm#61" target="notes">61</a></b></font></font></td>

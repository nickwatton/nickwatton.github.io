  <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It appears that those 
    who write about computer technologies in the arts and see it as limiting, 
    or take only a restricted view of it, bring contradictions and fears to the 
    surface. However, where it has been taken to extend and compliment the existing 
    human state as 'an affirmation of the fluidity of the body',<font size="1"><b><a href="endnotes.htm#71" target="notes">71</a></b></font> 
    the strengths of these developments come out. As I showed in my introduction, 
    Western society is labouring under the carapace of a philosophy that has had 
    more than two thousand years to harden. A result of this is a belief in a 
    stable world view, where the twin disciplines of logic and rational thought 
    have given untold progress. It seems reasonable, therefore, to encounter apprehension 
    when faced with a system that develops in a non-linear manner, and along the 
    fantastic lines of science fiction. </font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Artificial intelligence 
    research runs an annual competition (the Turing test), where computer programs 
    are tested alongside humans to see if they are approaching human intelligence 
    levels. The 1994 Turing test of artificial intelligence did not produce a 
    computer system that was judged to 'seem human'. However, one of the five 
    humans in the test used to provide a measure of 'human' was judged as less 
    human than the best program.<font size="1"><b><a href="endnotes.htm#72" target="notes">72</a></b></font> 
    </font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The rise, and implications 
    of artificial (non-human), intelligence has been debated for decades now, 
    from Stanley Kubrick's 1968 film <u>2001: A Space Odyssey</u> through Harry 
    Harrison's 1993 book <u>The Turing Option</u> and onwards. The 1994 Turing 
    test illustrates that 'real world' computers are still lagging behind science-fantasy 
    visions, but still does leave me wondering about human progression (regression?) 
    in the face of technological change. I will not fall in with the anti-computer 
    camp (Tierney et. al.), and see this as an example of the negative influence 
    of TV, and all that came after, upon the human race. Rather, I feel that used 
    with ingenuity and <i>intelligence</i> computers are incredibly powerful tools, 
    best exploited when people 'look the medium in its own terms, to work with 
    the medium and find its essence'.<b><font size="1"><a href="endnotes.htm#73" target="notes">73</a></font></b>

        today are increasingly relying on computer--based tools for such tasks

        costumes, storing and simulating dance notations, and, of course, writing 
        scripts.<b><font size="1"><a href="endnotes.htm#74" target="notes">74</a></font></b></font></td>

  <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Whilst Laurel's list above 
    is extensive, as I have shown in the preceding Stages, it is far from comprehensive. 
    Technologies, whether electric lighting or computers, can be (and have been), 
    used far more creatively than Laurel indicates. As a last example of what 
    is (will be), possible I shall refer to Ivor Benjamin, theatre writer / director 
    and PhD student in virtual reality, who features in an <u>Observer Review</u> 
    article 'Future Stages'. 'Theatre has traditionally lagged behind technology 
    ... but there will come a point where technology can co-exist and be part 
    of theatre.' Benjamin considers that holographic performances and performers, 
    productions in virtual-space where 'spectators' interact with the performance, 
    have 'got to happen by around the year 2000'. The article concludes that 'these 
    new freedoms for theatre aren't a pipe dream; they can be achieved, if primitively, 
    today'.<font size="1"><b><a href="endnotes.htm#75" target="notes">75</a></b></font>

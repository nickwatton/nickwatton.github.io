<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> The beginning of the Twentieth 
  Century saw a revolution in Western theatre, brought about in part by a questioning 
  of the function of theatre, but also through a development in the use of technologies 
  available to practitioners. The ritual function of ancient Greek theatre coupled 
  with the introduction of Stage devices such as the <i>eccyclema</i> had helped 
  to shape the staging of their dramas.<b><font size="1"><a href="endnotes.htm#8" target="notes">8</a></font></b> 
  Similarly a more egalitarian social view<b><font size="1"><a href="endnotes.htm#9" target="notes">9</a></font></b> 
  and the introduction of electric lighting (brought into theatres in the 1880's 
  as a replacement for gas lighting<font size="1"><b><a href="endnotes.htm#10" target="notes">10</a></b></font>) 
  was to significantly alter Western theatre at this time. </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">One figure who greatly influenced 
  this change was Adolphe Appia. His works began with a consideration of the best 
  manner to stage Richard Wagner's dramas and came to fruition through his collaboration 
  with Emile Jaques-Dalcroze and the development of 'Eurythmics'. </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In his book <u>Staging a 
  Wagnerian Drama</u> Appia wrote that he considered contemporary staging techniques 
  inadequate for what he saw as an entirely new theatrical form. The novelty of 
  these dramas came, for Appia, in the totality of the vision contained in Wagner's 
  writing. As such, Appia held that any production of Wagner's drama should be 
  produced with the eye of an auteur. However, rather than an auteur figure - 
  a director with an all encompassing vision or style - the individual work <i>itself</i> 
  should dictate the staging. It followed from this that there could be no single 
  approach to the Wagnerian drama (a style which Appia believed other writers 
  would follow), could be applied to all, or any two, works. </font></p>

    <td><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Can these demands [made 
      by the techniques required to Stage Wagnerian dramas] ever be laid down 
      in rigid rules? No, because they rely on nothing but the individual drama 
      itself, and do not rest safely on conventions, as in opera, nor on a more 
      or less faithful replica of life, as in spoken drama. Every drama can be 
      nothing more than a flexible tool, without rigidity determining matters.<font size="1"><b><a href="endnotes.htm#11" target="notes">11</a></b></font></font></td>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> As this suggests, Appia 
  saw Wagner's dramas as a move away from a naturalistic representation of events, 
  working with a rhythm outside any pattern set by life to 'create a duration 
  of its own'.<b><font size="1"><a href="endnotes.htm#12" target="notes">12</a></font></b> 
  This, therefore, discounted the idea of an absolute time scale for a theatre 
  production, (challenging, for example, the convention of a three hour long evening 
  with an interval). Rather, the correct time for a production was to be arrived 
  at through a consideration of the intrinsic rhythm of the individual work. </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The role of the actor within 
  any staging of the work was to faithfully convey to an audience such meaning 
  as the composer had written, without any personal interpretation. In order for 
  this to be possible the whole scenic arrangement had to be devised so that the 
  actor could faithfully express the content of the work. Given such an arrangement 
  the audience could 'finally... focus entirely on the work itself: and all those 
  worries about interpretation which at present are the death of drama, will be 
  reduced to a point that is hardly noticeable'.<font size="1"><b><a href="endnotes.htm#13" target="notes">13</a></b></font> 
  </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Towards this end Appia proposed, 
  through a series of essays and designs, a new theatre environment which would 
  allow the actor to deliver a role with the necessary expressivity. Such a renewing 
  of the theatre was needed as Appia saw that the proscenium arch theatre of the 
  time was orientated around the lighting of the painted scenery and not the body 
  of the actor. The new theatre Appia heralded hailed as its prime concern the 
  illumination of the actor and not the set. The re-evaluation that this brought 
  to theatre design concerned the placement of the actors physical body on stage. 
  In his essay 'Ideas for a Reform of our <i>Mise en Scene</i>' he describes his 
  ideas for the creation of staging designed around the actor where he, 'need 
  no longer walk <i>in front</i> of painted lights and shadows, but instead is 
  merged into an atmosphere <i>which is intended for him</i>.'<b><font size="1"><a href="endnotes.htm#14" target="notes">14</a> 
  </font></b></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">What is crucial here is 
  the discord Appia recognised between scenery painted in two dimensions, and 
  the three dimensional actor. Appia realised that the bias of the theatre towards 
  the scenic elements rather than the actor restricted the range of movement a 
  director might wish to explore on a stage. If, for example, a backdrop was painted 
  to create the impression of perspectives then an actor would have been limited 
  to a shallow acting area running parallel to it in order to maintain the illusion 
  for the audience. This forcing of the manner of staging through scenic rather 
  than actor centred considerations would have occurred as the painted backcloth, 
  being two-dimensional with a single perspectives view, formed a conflict with 
  the three dimensional actor, whose size would have appeared to alter in relation 
  to the scenery as she moved towards or away from it. </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">By focusing attention for 
  his new approach on lighting, and changes in staging elements (following the 
  replacement of scenic painting), Appia began to free the director from restrictions 
  such as those represented by the need to maintain an artificial perspectives 
  for the audience and opened up the whole stage area for movement. Following 
  this simple shift in staging Appia was able to work towards the principles for 
  production given in his essay 'Ideas for the reform of our <i>Mise en Scene</i>' 
  (1902): </font></p>

    <td><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">An object appears solid 
      before our eyes because light strikes it, and obviously it's solidity cannot 
      be emphasised artistically except by the artistic use of light. So much 
      for form. The movement of the human body requires obstacles through which 
      to express itself; all artists understand that the beauty of bodily movements 
      depends upon various points of resistance provided by the floor and other 
      objects.<br>
      The two fundamental conditions for an artistic rendering of the human body 
      on stage therefore would be light that enhances its three-dimensional quality, 
      and a solidly constructed setting that enhances it postures and movements. 
      We are far removed from painting!<b><font size="1"><a href="endnotes.htm#15" target="notes">15</a></font></b></font></td>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In the years prior to this 
  essay Appia had drawn many designs for hypothetical productions of Wagner's 
  dramas, such as the staging for Act 3 of <i>The Valkyrie</i> or a forest for 
  <i>Parsifal</i> (1896), it is possible to discern a development towards the 
  use of simplified 'block' staged elements, manipulation of horizontal and vertical 
  planes, combined with a subtle use of light. These characteristics serve to 
  enhance the actors body whilst at the same time providing boundaries, in the 
  form of different levels, 'walls' and areas of shadow, to restrict her movement 
  filling Appia's 'fundamental conditions' above. Later, in the retrospective 
  essay 'Theatrical Experiences and Personal Investigations' (1921) Appia wrote 
  that despite 'by means of these designs I gradually achieved a purity of style 
  which was composed for the most part by lines and forms.'<b><font size="1"><a href="endnotes.htm#16" target="notes">16</a></font></b>

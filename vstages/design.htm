<p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> In creating 
  the accompanying model I gave myself the task of designing a performance that 
  would represent 'memory' for me. Deciding too use memory as the subject of the 
  project began by chance following a conversation with Forced Entertainment's 
  Tim Etchells concerning a garage used to store old sets, (about which he said 
  it 'isn't a place; it's a state of mind'<b><font size="1"><a href="endnotes.htm#78" target="notes">78</a></font></b>). 
  An original experience-based idea, this comment, the current critical discourse 
  and electronic storage and retrieval systems all seemed to coalesce. Tim Etchells 
  had been describing a place the members of Forced Entertainment Co. did not 
  like to enter, because of the memories that the sets held inside might evoke. 
  Images and ideas perhaps painful to recall. Others that might hold joy, but 
  in a past moment when they had had a current and vital existence. Memories that 
  would necessarily reform and resignify if brought into the present as nostalgia. 
  And so their garage is kept locked, and the padlock has been allowed to rust. 
  Opening this room would require effort and breakage. The past would become current 
  and change. </font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The first sketches 
  for the design were of a large room with four smaller rooms leading off one 
  side, with a row of between eleven and sixteen pillars in front of, and a quarter 
  of the depth of the room away from, the doors. These pillars would obscure a 
  view of the doors unless one were to stand in the correct position for each 
  door. Perspective was thus employed as the collaborator of sight-line. The doors 
  to the our rooms would be opened and closed, revealing and hiding the activity 
  / object / sound / acting that was placed inside to act as a memory trigger. 
  </font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">There were 
  to be spotlights between the pillars which could be manoeuvred, changing the 
  areas of shadow and illumination as desired. </font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This space 
  would be an installation during the day, followed by an evening performance. 
  As an installation environment the 'audience' would have full control of the 
  doors, lights, and volume, whilst the actors would repeat loops of performance 
  within the rooms. As a performance space, the actors would perform in all of 
  the rooms, open and close doors, adjust the lights, and move members of the 
  audience, controlling what they would see and hear. </font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This idea the 
  evolved. The single wall of small rooms transformed, the result being that all 
  four walls would be covered in cupboards, each containing some combination of 
  sound / object / smell, each representing a memory for me, and hopefully capable 
  of evoking a memory in the audience members. The row of pillars was reduced 
  to only three which could be used to obscure something by hiding behind it, 
  or they could simply be rested against, perhaps to aid contemplation.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Inevitably 
  as an individual audience member would be able to face in only one direction, 
  and thus see only one set of cupboards, it would mean others would be obscured. 
  Choices could (would have to), be made with regard to sight. But scent, and 
  sound? These other traces and echoes would intrude regardless of choice, working 
  around the visual security of the pillars or the turned back. Smells would linger 
  even after doors to the cupboards containing them had been closed. Sometimes 
  long after. The lighting would still be manoeuvrable, but now I chose to have 
  the spotlights shining down from the ceiling, allowing only their reflections 
  to be adjusted via mirrors on the floor. In this way any lighting interaction 
  would be at one level of removal from the source. </font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This arrangement 
  of the set could also function in the same way as the first. It would work either 
  as an installation environment for free exploration, or the movement and attention 
  could be controlled in an actor led performance. </font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In operation, 
  the public would initially enter the room with all the cupboard doors shut. 
  Opening a door would break a seal, so that it could not be closed again immediately. 
  Inside the cupboards would be a variety of objects: books, personal artefacts, 
  projected images, photographs, abstract creations etc. These would be accompanied 
  by sounds: recordings of children playing, trains, cars, sections of text being 
  read, music, random noises. Finally the cupboards would contain scents, both 
  pleasant and obnoxious, from a similarly wide ranging set of sources as the 
  objects and sounds. </font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The public 
  would be free to arrange, and rearrange, the elements as they choose, to create 
  their own patterns of significance. Of course the choices made by any one individual 
  might well conflict with the choices of others. This feature of the work reflects 
  Cage's work and the manner in which our everyday interaction effects our internal 
  thought processes. Other people will sometimes interrupt trains of thought, 
  but equally may make previously unthought of, but relevant connections for us.

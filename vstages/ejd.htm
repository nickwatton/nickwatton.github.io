<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Appia's work 
  truly came to fruition through his collaboration with Emile Jaques-Dalcroze. 
  The artistic relationship between these two practitioners was mutually beneficial, 
  giving to Jacques Dalcroze a theatre for his Eurhythmics, and supplying Appia 
  with a working forum for the application and development of his designs and 
  theories of theatre production. The great excitement felt by these two visionaries 
  on meeting a like mind is captured by Volbach in his profile of Appia, when 
  describing his first encounter with Jaques-Dalcroze's work. </font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Jaques-Dalcroze 
  was interested in developing a form of movement which would allow an actor to 
  make physically manifest the content of music. The resultant movement form was 
  called Eurhythmics and described as a 'definite thought in space'.<font size="1"><b><a href="endnotes.htm#18" target="notes">18</a></b></font> 
  Where a musical score contained the visible thoughts of the composer, so the 
  eurhythmic performer was to become the medium by which such musical expression 
  would become physically, and thus visible for a spectator. This view of the 
  relationship between theatre and music closely coincided with that held by Appia, 
  allowing the works of each to complement and advance the investigations asked 
  the other. </font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In response 
  to his first encounter with eurhythmics, performed on a conventional (open) 
  stage, Appia wrote to Jacques-Dalcroze that the dancers 'moving on a flat surface 
  gave the impression of alpinists ascending a bas relief spread on the floor'.<font size="1"><b><a href="endnotes.htm#19" target="notes">19</a></b></font> 
  Through this, Appia described his belief that an uninterrupted stage floor lent 
  no support to the purpose of the movement. To accompany this letter Appia created 
  several '<i>Espaces Rhythmiques</i>', spaces designed to be ideal for movement. 
  These were composed of platforms dividing the stage into many levels, ramps, 
  stairs, plain walls and pillars. These elements could all be moved to provide 
  a flexible space which could be moulded to fit the needs of the drama - just 
  as Jacques-Dalcroze's eurhythmics allowed the performer to be manipulated. In 
  response to the set resulting from these designs Jacques-Dalcroze wrote, </font></p>

    <td><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">For training exercises 
      these movable elements are invaluable to me - they allow us to discover 
      new postures in conditions of balance. But from the artistic point of view 
      - so long as light has not come into play - the feeling of life is definitely 
      missing and those constructions of levels and planes seem mere skeletons 
      or dummies.<font size="1"><b><a href="endnotes.htm#20" target="notes">20</a></b></font></font></td>

<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This call for 
  lighting struck to the core of Appia's work. It was light which unified the 
  whole drama, enlightening performer's bodies and settings alike. Where eurhythmics 
  was a 'definite thought in space' rather than being merely movement, so light 
  ceased to be purely for illumination, and would 'radiate, carrying form into 
  space'.<font size="1"><b><a href="endnotes.htm#21" target="notes">21</a> </b></font></font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The new use 
  of light that Appia proposed was not confined to the stage but was to include 
  moves towards the fusion of the stage and auditorium. In his design for Jacques-Dalcroze 
  production of <i>Orpheus and Eurydice</i> at Hellerau (1912) Appia covered the 
  sides of the theatre with backlit canvas walls, smoothing the transition between 
  the bright stage hand the semi-dark house. This was part of his attempt to lessen 
  the passivity of the audience, encouraging them to take a greater responsibility 
  for the stage action. In 'Eurythmics and the Theatre' Appia wrote, </font></p>
<table width="75%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="center">
  <tr>
    <td><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Up to now only quiet 
      attention has been required of the audience. To encourage this, comfortable 
      seats have been provided in semi-darkness, to encourage a state of total 
      passivity - evidently the proper attitude for spectators.... <i>Eurythmics 
      will overturn this passivity!</i> Musical rhythm will enter all of us, to 
      say: <i>you yourself</i> are the work of art.<b><font size="1"><a href="endnotes.htm#22" target="notes">22</a></font></b></font></td>

<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The above shows 
  a development on his earlier essay, 'Solidarity and Style' (1909), where he 
  proposed that the artist and the public are <i>both</i> responsible for the 
  creation of art. In this essay he wrote that artists should draw upon the public 
  as the subject of their art, whilst the public must engage with the art which 
  would thus offer up a reflection of themselves. In this way Appia's ideal audience 
  contributed to the creation of art and were not merely consumers.<b><font size="1"><a href="endnotes.htm#23" target="notes">23</a></font></b> 
  </font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In 'The Origin 
  and beginnings of Eurithmics' Appia recounted an event which demonstrates how 
  closely this view was shared by Jaques-Dalcroze. He related how in 1906 Jaques-Dalcroze 
  held a two week course to present the results of his investigations into eurhythmics 
  to the public. </font></p>

  <tr>
    <td><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">All the participants 
      expected that the course would be a series of lectures illustrated with 
      student exercises, and thus edified they would return home thoroughly informed 
      about eurhythmics. How mistaken they were! After five minutes the master 
      [Jaques-Dalcroze] let us know that everyone had to descend into the arena 
      to undergo the great experience for themselves. Everyone refused! Was intelligence 
      not enough; did the whole body have to take part? Did one have to expose 
      oneself to this ridiculous test? The moment was both comic and serious. 
      ... It was <i>necessary</i> that from then on everyone should understand 
      that eurhythmics is a <i>personal</i> experience and not a method. At all 
      costs, it must be so.<b><font size="1"><a href="endnotes.htm#24" target="notes">24</a></font></b></font></td>

<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This demonstrates 
  a vision of an equality between performer and spectator in the creation of art, 
  shared by these two artists. This, combined with the changes in the approach 
  to staging and movement their work represents, pointed towards a radical change 
  in the evolution of live performance. In 'Eurythmics and Theatre' Appia warned 
  that the new style of production should not be conducted on conventional stages. 
  A total reworking of the system of presentation would be necessary for the vision 
  to be realised. </font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Sadly, such 
  changes were not fully realised. The work of Edward Gordon Craig which was superficially 
  similar to Appia's, but perhaps less socially challenging,<b><font size="1"><a href="endnotes.htm#25" target="notes">25</a></font></b> 
  is well documented, (having been adapted as the heralding light of the new theatrical 
  era). The stylistic change Craig's work represented (crossing over with Appia), 
  provided enough of a distinction between theatre and the infant cinema to secure 
  the position of live performance, without disrupting the social hierarchies 
  it embodied: The passive spectator could wait patiently for Craig's Uber-Marrionette 
  to perform for them - faultlessly, without having to use their whole body.<b><font size="1"><a href="endnotes.htm#26" target="notes">26</a></font></b> 
  </font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The end of 
  the century which began in this auspicious manner is beginning to realise its 
  pedigree. The rise of the performance installation out of a cross-over between 
  art and live performance carries with it principles of the shared responsibility 
  between the artist and public for the creation of an art-work - principles recognisable 
  is Appia and Jaques-Dalcroze's work. Furthermore, the insurgence of ever newer 
  technologies, computers and the potential they offer for the creation of a new 
  interactive performance medium, require a re-evaluation of performance at least 
  of the magnitude Appia and Jaques-Dalcroze proposed. </font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Within this 
  last century the have, of course, been practitioners and theorists who may be 
  seen to have developed their work within areas recognisably similar to those 
  proposed by Appia. John Cage and Merce Cunningham's work at the Black Mountain 
  College, called for the individual to supply meaning to a performance event. 
  Robert Wilson's experimentation with staging and light also provoked audience 
  involvement, challenging accepted expectations about where to focus attention 
  at any given moment of a performance. Even the traditional social centre of 
  a theatre event - the interval - was subverted in his 'operas'. These extended 
  performances allowed the audience freedom to enter and leave a performance as 
  they pleased. </font></p>

  <p align="center"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Cage's 
    collaboration with Merce Cunningham</b></font></p>
  <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Cage began 
    his investigations into the performance of indeterminacy in 1952, producing 
    <i>Untitled Event</i> in collaboration with Merce Cunningham at the Black 
    Mountain College. For this Cage gave a group of dancers, actors and musicians 
    'time-scores', that is a list of time-intervals designating a sequence of 
    activity or inactivity, sound or silence. The time-intervals indicated by 
    the scores were not chosen but rather arrived at by chance, through the use 
    of a Chinese fortune telling system. Each artist in the event was given a 
    different score to which they were to compose - in isolation from any other 
    artist - a performance. The event was performed without any rehearsal, and 
    thus required that each performer fit their own composition, physical and/or 
    aural, around those others who simultaneously occupied the space. </font></p>
  <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">As a result 
    of this structuring of the total event through completely separate elements, 
    Cage created a performance over which no single person had total control. 
    The performers could not completely control their individual pieces, as another 
    artist might have needed the same space they had intended to use, forcing 
    them to adapt and improvise. The spectator was presented with no narrative 
    structure, indeed no single structure at all trough which they might focus 
    on the event. Rather, they were required to be selectively attentive, concentrating 
    now on one performer, now on another, now on the interaction between two/three/...,<font size="1"><b><a href="endnotes.htm#33" target="notes">33</a></b></font> 
    making their own connections and creating their own meanings from what they 
    saw and heard. </font></p>
  <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">As well as 
    being an 'evening of performance that [...] created a precedent for innumerable 
    events that were to follow',<b><font size="1"><a href="endnotes.htm#34" target="notes">34</a></font></b> 
    this production also marked a significant point in the collaboration between 
    Cage and Cunningham. Throughout their overlapping careers they worked together 
    in very much the manner prescribed by <i>Untitled Event</i>. Cunningham's 
    dance company would prepare their performance, and Cage would compose some 
    music. The first occasion that the two creations would come together would 
    be at the first performance, the dancers having to (not) fit their dance to 
    the music. The principle was one of co-existence, rather than symbiosis: any 
    'fit' between music and dance was let to chance, left for the audience to 
    discover. Cage wanted people to understand by his that there is no single 
    interpretation of events, that the individual must make their own sense of 
    such phenomena as they discover. Paul Griffiths wrote in a review a Cage's 
    career that 'Cage would wish that his music might be of assistance to people 
    who must conduct themselves in a world so complex that much must seem haphazard',<b><font size="1"><a href="endnotes.htm#35" target="notes">35</a></font></b> 
    </font></p>
  <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In addition 
    to their shared compositional and performance methods, Cage and Cunningham 
    have each also applied technologies in an innovative manner to their creative 
    process. For example, in certain of his writings, Cage has replaced the Chinese 
    fortune telling system with computers to randomly create the elements of his 
    work. Cunningham, during the creation of the made-for-video dance <i>Points 
    in Space</i>,<b><font size="1"><a href="endnotes.htm#36" target="notes">36</a></font></b> 
    recognised that video presented a different space to the stage. In the light 
    of this he choreographed the piece via a camera and T.V. screen. Furthermore, 
    the camera (and camera operator), were also choreographed ('by the end of 
    the week [of studio rehearsals] even the camera was dancing'<font size="1"><b><a href="endnotes.htm#37" target="notes">37</a></b></font>). 
    </font></p>
  <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Whilst watching 
    the television program about <i>Points in Space</i> it seemed apparent that 
    the camera choreography was ideally suited to an application of computer technology. 
    Cunningham was forced to produce a paper score for the camera as the cost 
    of hiring the film equipment for the rehearsal period was prohibitive. Had 
    a (relatively), inexpensive computer system with a range of 'cameras' been 
    used,<b><font size="1"><a href="endnotes.htm#38" target="notes">38</a></font></b> 
    then all camera movements and views could have been fully explored in advance. 
    Due to the speed of developments in the computer graphics field, even three 
    years ago, when <i>Points in Space</i> was created, such graphics systems 
    were not available. Now that they are available, however, it would be interesting 
    to see random generations employed to Cage to direct camera choreography. 
    This would create a performance of music and dance, where movement, sound, 
    and camera would all bear indeterminate relationships toward one another.

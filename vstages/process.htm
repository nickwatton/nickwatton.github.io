  about the process of its creation.</b></font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Ideally the 
  design for this installation would have included all the elements, sound / object 
  / scent mentioned. However, technical restrictions have made this impossible. 
  The memory capacity within a computer necessary to provide the details of all 
  such objects as I have planned to have in the cupboards was not available, resulting 
  in a simplification of the design. For example, the number of opening cupboards 
  had to be limited to two, whereas at the outset all the doors opened revealing 
  spaces and objects. </font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Further, the 
  original intention had been to show a range of possible object groupings, and 
  to move some objets around the space. This would have been done with the object 
  in view, as if being carried, adding to the sense of being inside the space. 
  Olfaction was never an option on the computer model, but a set of phials containing 
  odoriferous substances to have accompanied the video would have been included 
  if everything else had been possible, attesting to the power of smell to 'engender 
  reminiscence itself'.<font size="1"><b><a href="endnotes.htm#79" target="notes">79</a></b></font> 
  </font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The set model 
  was constructed using a package of linked programs, with the group name '3DStudio'. 
  Within this package 3D objects can be created from simple 2D shapes, assembled, 
  coloured, moved, and viewed from any angle. I chose to use gold as a personally 
  significant colour combined with rose for the walls to suggest the positive 
  'colouring' often associated with memories. It was possible to 'mix' the colours 
  I wanted using the program, rather than being restricted by a predetermined 
  and limited palette. </font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Once the set 
  was completed (working systematically - no working order prescribed), I was 
  able to light the environment I had created. Where in the composition of the 
  set I had been conscious to utilise my Cageian / critical theory base, and allow 
  authority to be ceded to the spectator, at this stage I concentrated (with respect 
  to Appia), on my use of light. The significance of this element has not been 
  lost on those who theorise on the creation of virtual environments: </font></p>

    <td><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Lighting in the artificial 
      world is also very important. We pick up a lot of information from lighting. 
      Current artificial worlds have a pervasive, monotonous glare. Lighting reveals 
      an artistic mastery in the creation of artificial worlds in many media.<b><font size="1"><a href="endnotes.htm#80" target="notes">80</a></font></b></font></td>

<p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Working in 
  virtual space one becomes very aware of the need for shadow to give a realistic 
  'feel' to an environment. It is in this area that the program I have been working 
  with succeeds where others fail, as it allows the user not only to make the 
  environment, add colour and coloured light, but also to sculpt the space with 
  shadow. </font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Unfortunately, 
  whilst this process allows for the creation of more 'real' environments, it 
  also accounts for most of the memory requirement. However, before one becomes 
  overburdened with the details of possible technical developments, the usefulness 
  of computer aided design needs to be assessed. </font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Conversations 
  with the director of Montage Graphics reinforced my understanding that the main 
  function of any design presentation is to physically communicate a visual concept 
  to another person. Working within a field where design is being produced with 
  the intention to replicate it in the physical environment (ie a theatre / performance 
  space), requires that the conditions of that environment are included in any 
  model. Because of computer modelling's ability to include lighting arrangements, 
  it scores above traditional set design methods which cannot simulate stage lighting. 
  </font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Equally significant 
  is the ability of the user to 'walk through' a design, and thus view it from 
  any angle, achieving a true audience (or actor), perspective. I feel that these 
  are the areas of real strength for 3D computer aided design, and represents 
  a very real advantage of a computer model over a more traditional set model. 
  </font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">To conclude, 
  for me the advantages of this technology are obvious and I feel that, given 
  appropriate resources, it would become widely used and accepted. I also believe, 
  however, that to use it purely for design would be to overlook its real potentials. 
  The ability to create, unfettered by linearity, or realism if the model is not 
  to be reproduced in the 'real' world, leaves the only limitations in the creativity 
  of the user. (This is, ironically, given the subject of my design, not quite 
  true. The limits of a computer's memory (I used all there was available), can 
  be a very 'real' limitation to 'virtual' creativity ...) </font></p>

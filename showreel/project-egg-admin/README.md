# Project Egg Admin

# This is an admin tool for Project Egg which we use to approve/reject eggs created by users, and check whether flagged eggs merit removal from the API.

## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build
```

					<p>These graphics are created by combining stereo waveforms of specially created music. The original artist is Jerobeam Fenderson (<a href="http://oscilloscopemusic.com" target="_blank">oscilloscopemusic.com</a>) who creates music that can be visualised through an oscilloscope.</p>
					<p>As I don't have an oscilloscope, I thought I would code a JavaScript player that did the same thing.</p>
					<p>I'm using the HTML5 Audio API to the play and interpret his tracks, and running the visualisation through canvas.</p>
					<p>This demo is using the track "Planets". I highly recommend you check the whole album which you can buy complete with videos. The results through the oscilloscope have a smoother feel.</p>

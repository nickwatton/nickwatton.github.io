              <p>Following a chat with the marking team, I grabbed a quiet moment to create a small series of internal branding animations based on the neon identity ClearSky have around the office.</p>

              <p>Building on a long-term understanding of Scot.Gov requirements, Storm undertook a project to use AI to auto-generate forms from a variety of sources.</p>
              <p>As the lead front end developer my primary role was to ensure a coherent front end design, and provide any DOM manipulation JavaScript. In addition, throughout the project daily stand-ups provided the space for me to reflect on the UI, UX and accessibility directions the (backend driven) build was taking, and keeping it honest!</p>
              <p>A small UX discussion about visual representaions of a user's journey through a complex chart led to me implimenting the Mermaid charting library which swiftly become a central pillar of the projects UI.</p>

              <p>As the lead front end developer on the project I implementated the Scot.Gov design system, integrated with Storm's own design agnostic scaffold. I was responsible for ensuring that during the process of .Net implementation WCAG 2.2 accessibility standards were maintained, and providing any DOM manipulation or forms related JavaScript as required.</p>
              <p>One such custom element was a tool for accurately mapping the boundaries of a property. For this we used the OpenSystemsLab geo-data mapping API, and you can see a test implementation via the link below.</p>
              <p>The project is not yet live, but the Scot.Gov Digital Planning team intends to take the alpha service prototypes forward to beta and live, in line with its digital strategy.</p>

              <p>Following the Glasgow Life transformation, Storm was tasked with a similar overhaul of the sister site, Glasgow Club.</p>
              <p>Glasgow Club has a distinct design language from other sites in the group, so whilst the underlying scaffold is largely shared across the estate, as lead front end developer on the project, I needed to take care that all details of their design were implemented correctly.</p>
              <p>Whilst many of the challenges from Glasgow Life had been solved for this build, the scale of tabular data presented for venues and activities proved an issue. Smaller tables (opening times) maintained visual structure and only changed width responsively. Larger tables required a visual collapsing of <code>&lt;td&gt;</code> elements, whilst maintaining DOM structure and coherence for keyboard users.</p>

              <p>Storm took Glasgow Life through a complete digital transformation programme, redeveloping their main web portal, and dedicated venue and event sites.</p>
              <p>As the lead front end developer on the project I ensured the design was faithfully implemented, and ensured accessibility standards were maintained.</p>
              <p>Interesting challenges included the map view for the venue finder, bespoke Swiper carousel conflicts, and much longer than expected horizontal in-page navigations. However, working closely with the design, UX, and testing teams, all issues were resolved to the client's satisfaction.</p>

              <p>The Historic Environment Scotland (HES) estate comprises some 30+ separately maintained websites, build over many years with multiple technologies. And they all needed to have their cookie banner updated and WCAG 2.2 compliant.</p>
              <p>My role was to adapt their existing cookie banner code for compliance (specifically ensuring no interactive elements are obscured), to be standardised for all sites, with configuration options, but without the need for an implementing developer to customise the JavaScript.</p>
              <p>Final delivery was with a <code>.umd</code> JavaScript bundle with a configuration object in a <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> tag. I provided extensive documentation for HES developers to use, and was available for support when some implementations where less straightforward and the HES developer needed assistance.</p>

              <p>When the COPFS started to return to office work after lockdown, they needed a tool to allow staff to book desk space. I converted paper office layout charts into data, in JSON format, which allowed all offices / desks to be dynamically drawn and interacted with. Booking data was submitted to their existing SharePoint intranet.</p>

              <p>I first approached Realise as a Flash/actionscript developer looking to transition into HTML5 work. I had a little JS / CSS / HTML experience, and although I had 14 years Flash experience I was wet behind my HTML5 ears.</p>
              <p>However, Realise had a few banner clients which needed to be transitioned to HTML5 builds, and I had made a lot of banners at Wunderman and Saint (RKCR/y&r), and the deal was struck.<br>I made a build pipeline in Gulp, set guides and processes, and arranged training so other team members could join the fun.</p>
              <p>Banners production sat in Support, so I also worked on (amongst others) Standard Life Investments and Lloyds Banking Group CMS sites, using Teamsite and Ektron.<br>In addition, I helped in development teams for multiple smaller projects, and championed team learning through skill share excercises and addressed topics like Imposter Syndrome and general mental health.</p>

              <p>At Realise I built 10s of campaigns (each with 10-14 individually sized units) for Heathrow. I really enjoy the specific challenges of making banners work. They must be lightweight, and the design and animation immediately engaging. It looks easy but it needs a fine eye for detail and a high level of trust between designer and developer.</p>

              <p>As a self-taught developer on CSS through practice not study, I wanted to develop a deeper understanding of the principles that underlie CSS. This course has been instrumental in filling gaps, and enhancing my skills.</p>

              <p>I've been making web-based animations for years, and when this course popped up I thought it would be good to shake myself up and learn some new techniques. The course has confirmed my growing love of SVGs, and greatly deepened my understanding of CSS animation.</p>

              <p>I actively enjoying my development work, but within squads I find myself taking on mentoring and somewhat-management roles. I took this course to gain greater understanding of this area, and to build some foundational skills.</p>

              <p>Building on the foundations laid in the previous course, this training delved deeper into the principles of effective engineering management. It probably took me past where I project myself being for now. However, it was really useful in helping me understand the breadth of management tasks, and will certainly be useful for my skills as a senior team member.</p>

              <p>Made during a hack week at Secureworks, with an idea that it could be an easter egg on a 404 page.</p>
              <p>A horizontal scolling invaders game, with handrawn graphics. Vanilla JavaScript, using ES6 modules. The first two waves of invaders are hand coded to spell a message (originally relevant as a 404), then afterwards we fall back to an endless random enemy pattern generator.</p>
              <p>I revisted this to make a JS13K Games entry. I managed to keep it hand-drawn, and although I did need to cut the parallax environment layers I was able to add light-speed star effects.</p>

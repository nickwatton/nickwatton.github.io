						<p>Building on a long-term understanding of Scot.Gov requirements, Storm undertook a project to use AI to auto-generate forms from a variety of sources.</p>
						<p>As the lead front end developer my primary role was to ensure a coherent front end design, and provide any DOM manipulation JavaScript. In addition, throughout the project daily stand-ups provided the space for me to reflect on the UI, UX and accessibility directions the (backend driven) build was taking, and keeping it honest!</p>
						<p>A small UX discussion about visual representaions of a user's journey through a complex chart led to me implimenting the Mermaid charting library which swiftly become a central pillar of the projects UI.</p>

						<p>A large scale Scot.Gov project to review the existing online planning permission process.</p>
						<p>As the lead front end developer on the project I implementated the Scot.Gov design system, integrated with Storm's own design agnostic scaffold. I was responsible for ensuring that during the process of .Net implementation WCAG 2.2 accessibility standards were maintained, and providing any DOM manipulation or forms related JavaScript as required.</p>
						<p>One such custom element was a tool for accurately mapping the boundaries of a property. For this we used the OpenSystemsLab geo-data mapping API, and you can see a test implementation via the link below.</p>

						<p>Following the Glasgow Life transformation, Storm was tasked with a similar overhaul of the sister site, Glasgow Club.</p>
						<p>Glasgow Club has a distinct design language from other sites in the group, so whilst the underlying scaffold is largely shared across the estate, as lead front end developer on the project, I needed to take care that all details of their design were implemented correctly.</p>
						<p>Whilst many of the challanges from Glasgow Life had been solved for this build, the scale of tablular data presented for venues and activities proved an issue. Smaller tables (opening times) maintained visual structure and only changed width responsively. Larger tables required a visual collapsing of <code>&lt;td&gt;</code> elements, whilst maintaining DOM structure and coherance for keyboard users.</p>

						<p>Storm took Glasgow Life through a complete digital transformation programme, redeveloping their main web portal, and dedicated venue and event sites.</p>
						<p>As the lead front end developer on the project I ensured the design was faithfully implimented, and ensured accessibility standards were maintained.</p>
						<p>Interesting challanges included the map view for the venue finder, bespoke Swiper carousel conflicts, and much longer than expected horizontal in-page navigations. However, working closely with the design, UX, and testing teams, all issues were resolved to the client's satisfaction.</p>

						<p>The Historic Environment Scotland (HES) estate comprises some 30+ separately maintained websites, build over many years with multiple technologies. And they all needed to have their cookie banner updated and WCAG 2.2 compliant.</p>
						<p>My role was to adapt their existing cookie banner code for compliance (specifically ensuring no interactive elements are obscured), to be standardised for all sites, with configuration options, but without the need for an implementing developer to customise the JavaScript.</p>
						<p>Final delivery was with a <code>.umd</code> JavaScript bundle with a configuration object in a <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> tag. I provided extensive documentation for HES developers to use, and was available for support when some implementations where less straightforward and the HES developer needed assistance.</p>

						<p>At Realise I built 10s of campaigns (each with 10-14 individually sized units) for Heathrow. I really enjoy the specific challenges of making banners work. They must be lightweight, and the design and animation immediately engaging. It looks easy but it needs a fine eye for detail and a high level of trust between designer and developer.</p><img loading="lazy" class="secondary" alt="Still image from Heathrow banner ad showing a family walking in woods on holiday" src="./images/thumb/heathrow_17WoP_01.png">

						<p>The sound artist Jerobeam Fenderson (oscilloscopemusic.com) creates music that can be visualised through an oscilloscope. I don't have an oscilloscope, so I wrote a JavaScript player that does the same thing.</p>
						<p>This is not an animation.</p>
						<p>The graphics are the visual output of specially created music, produced by combining the stereo waveforms.</p>

						<p>I co-ran a team building challenge, to paint 3D Easter Eggs, then create a game or interface to use the resultant images.</p>
						<p>My primary role was creating the initial paint application, using canvas for the main painting app, and live rendering the result onto an interactive 3D egg.</p>
						<p>I also took responsibility for encouraging colleagues to contribue to the project, helping with the egg API.</p>
